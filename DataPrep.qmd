Opening the correct packages:

```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)
library(ggplot2) 
library(tidyverse)
library(DigitalMethodsData)
library(ggmap)
library(tidygeocoder)
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)
library(leaftime)
library(leaflet.providers)
library(spatstat)
```

Registering my Google Key:

```{r}
#register google key 
register_google(key = Sys.getenv("GOOGLE_KEY"))
```

inserting data sets and prepping them to be geo-coded:

```{r}
locations <- read.csv("locations3.csv") %>% 
  mutate(full.address = paste0(street.address,","," ", city, ",", " ", state))
entries <- read.csv("entries3.csv") %>% 
  mutate(full.address = paste0(street.address,","," ", city, ",", " ", state))
people <- read.csv("people3.csv") 
#I dont think I can geocode multiple street addresses for the people table, instead I will geocode only the locations and entries table, I can track the womens movements by their people i.d
```

geocoding data:

```{r}

```
